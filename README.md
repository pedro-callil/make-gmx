make GMX
========

This repository hosts files used to script GROMACS simulations, with initial
configuration in PACKMOL. The file `Makefile` must be edited to comply with the
topology file (for GROMACS) and input file (for PACKMOL). Then, one can run
their simulation simply by executing `make`.

Dependencies
------------

[GROMACS](https://www.gromacs.org/), [PACKMOL](https://m3g.github.io/packmol/)
and [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/).
